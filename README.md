### What I learned

While working through this project, I learned how to use JavaScript Closures. How to add, read and remove data items from the localStorage. How to use the JavaScript Date objects to get the current date, time, and calculate elapsed time. And how to create modal boxes.

### Continued development

Areas that I would want to continue focusing on in future projects includes other storage methods like sessionStorage, CacheStorage, IndexedDB, etc.

### Useful resources

- [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) - This is a resource I'd recommend to anyone who wants to learn about JavaScript Closures.
- [JavaScript Date Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) - This is a resource I'd recommend to anyone who wants to learn about JavaScript Date objects.
- [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - This is a resource I'd recommend to anyone who wants to learn about localStorage.
- [Modal Box](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp) - This is a resource I'd recommend to anyone who wants to learn how to create Modal boxes.
